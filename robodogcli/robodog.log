[2025-08-23 16:17:52,155] INFO:Included 3 files; summary: Here’s a high-level summary of the three files you’ve included:

1. clibak.py  
   - Implements the RoboDog CLI client.  
   - Loads a YAML config (providers, models, MCP server info).  
   - Manages chat context and knowledge, dispatches user input to either OpenAI or an MCP server.  
   - Provides commands like `/model`, `/include`, `/import`, stash/pop, parameter tuning, and streams responses from the LLM.  
   - The `/include` command pulls files from the MCP server into the local knowledge base and automatically asks the model to summarize them.

2. mcpbak.py  
   - A standalone MCP (Model-Client Protocol) file-server over HTTP/TCP.  
   - Serves one or more root directories under a bearer-token scheme.  
   - Supports commands: LIST_FILES, GET_ALL_CONTENTS, READ/UPDATE/CREATE/DELETE/APPEND files, CREATE/DELETE dirs, RENAME/MOVE/COPY, SEARCH by glob, CHECKSUM, HELP, QUIT.  
   - Enforces that all paths stay within configured roots.

3. robodog.py  
   - A combined script that launches the MCP file-server and the RoboDog CLI in one process.  
   - Configures logging to console and file, parses command-line args for folders, token, model, etc.  
   - Starts a threaded MCP server serving the given folders, then runs the same CLI logic as in clibak.py.  
   - Allows seamless include/import of local files into the LLM’s knowledge and live chat with contextual memory.
