# Task Plan: Add Logging to file_service.py

## Task Summary
The task is to enhance the `file_service.py` module by adding comprehensive logging to its methods. This improves traceability, debugging, and monitoring of file operations without altering the core functionality.

## Planned Changes
1. **Add Logging in Existing Methods**:
   - In `__init__`: Log initialization details including roots and exclude_dirs.
   - In `search_files`: Log search parameters (patterns, roots, exclusions) and total matches.
   - In `find_files_by_pattern` and `find_matching_file`: Log search results and matches.
   - In `resolve_path`: Log resolution attempts and outcomes.
   - In `safe_read_file` and `binary_read`: Log read operations, token counts, and any errors (e.g., binary detection).
   - In `write_file`: Log write attempts, atomic vs. fallback, and success with token counts.
   - In `ensure_dir`, `delete_file`, `append_file`, `delete_dir`, `rename`, `copy_file`: Add entry/exit logs, successes, and errors.

2. **Logging Levels**:
   - DEBUG: Method entry/exit, detailed parameters (e.g., full paths, patterns).
   - INFO: Successful operations (e.g., "Successfully read file: X, Y tokens", "Search completed: Z files matched").
   - WARNING: Non-critical issues (e.g., "Root directory not found: X", "Binary content detected").
   - ERROR: Failures (e.g., "Failed to read X: reason").

3. **No Structural Changes**:
   - Preserve all existing logic, imports, and structure.
   - Ensure logging is non-intrusive (no performance impact in production).
   - File remains self-contained and executable.

4. **plan.md Update**:
   - This file itself is being updated (not NEW) to reflect the plan and changes.
   - Add section for verification and next steps.

## Implementation Steps
1. Review current logging: Some DEBUG/INFO logs exist; enhance for completeness.
2. Insert logs strategically: At method start/end, key operations (e.g., mkdir, os.walk, read/write).
3. Test: Ensure logs appear correctly without breaking functionality (e.g., no exceptions in logging).
4. Line Count: Original ~223 lines; expected addition ~12 lines for logs.

## Next Steps
- **Verification**: Run unit tests on FileService methods; check logs for all paths (success/error).
- **Integration**: Ensure logs integrate with global logging config (e.g., colorlog in CLI).
- **Future Enhancements**: Add log levels configurable via args; consider structured logging (JSON) for production.
- **Related Tasks**: If needed, propagate logs to dependent services (e.g., TodoService file ops).

This update ensures better observability in file operations, aiding debugging in multi-root environments.
