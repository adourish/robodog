```knowledge
1. fix rendering the UI on startup. print a loading, loaded message.
2. fix allowing commands
3. the logger is messing the screen up when it runs
4. we should have a command window and an output window like in the react app

  1. **Wire the TodoService (and/or any other sub‐services) into your dashboard’s `update_ui` callback**  
     In your `DashboardScreen.__init__` (after `svc.set_ui_callback(…)`) also add:

         if hasattr(self.svc, "todo"):
             self.svc.todo.set_ui_callback(self.update_ui)

     That way every time the file-watcher or `run_next_task()` in `TodoService` does a `self._ui_callback(...)`, it will end up in `output_log`.

  2. **Auto-scroll your log to the bottom**  
     By default `RichLog` in a `VerticalScroll` will happily write new lines *off* the bottom of the viewport.  Immediately after every `write()` you can do:

         await self.output_log.action_scroll_end()

     or if you aren’t in an async context, schedule it with `self.call_later(self.output_log.action_scroll_end)`.  That will keep your view pinned to the latest messages.

With those two changes in place:

  • any call to `self.update_ui(msg)` will append `msg` to the on-screen log  
  • the screen will stay scrolled to the bottom so you *see* `/models`, `/todo` or any file-watcher notices the instant they arrive  

You should also audit any other calls to `logger.info()` in your code – those will still go to your log file (or be dropped from stdout), not to the UI.  If you want truly everything in the UI you must replace them (or add) calls to your UI callback, e.g.:

    if self._ui_callback:
        self._ui_callback("…this is now a UI message…")

```
