1. change _resolve_path only
2. loop through all of the include: pattern=*robodog*.md|*robodog*.py  recursive` files
3. if focus includes the path in focus, use this full path.
4. ensure to use the full path with wildcard. you should find the temp folder.

  Ambiguous focus '*robodogcli\temp\todo.py' matched multiple files: ['c:\\projects\\robodog\\robodogcli\\robodog\\todo.py', 'c:\\projects\\robodog\\robodogcli\\temp\\todo.py']. Defaulting to c:\projects\robodog\robodogcli\robodog\todo.py

```knowledge
1. generate a features.md file. 
2. it should create a section for each python file cli.py, service.py, todo.py, and mcphandler.
3. describe what each function does so you could recreate it.
