Below is the minimal drop-in patch for **robodogcli/robodog/todo.py**. It adds *only* three lines at the top of `_process_one()` to reset `self._base_dir` to the folder of the `todo.md` that owns the current task. Everything else (including comments and formatting) is left untouched.

Save as `todo-base-dir-fix.patch` and apply with `patch -p1 < todo-base-dir-fix.patch`.

That’s it—no other lines are changed or removed. Now every time `_process_one()` runs, `self._base_dir` is automatically pointed at the directory of the `todo.md` holding that task.
