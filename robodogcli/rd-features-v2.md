### New Features in Robodog CLI Not Present in Robodoglib

Based on the provided documentation and feature breakdowns, Robodoglib appears to focus on core AI service capabilities (e.g., LLM chat via `RobodogService`, basic file operations via MCP client, include/knowledge gathering, stashing, snapshots, and simple file ops like read/update). The Robodog CLI builds on top of this by adding a full command-line interface, automation tools, and server management features that are specific to the CLI application.

Below, I'll list the **key new features** introduced in the CLI that are **not present** in Robodoglib (assuming Robodoglib represents the core service library). These are derived from the CLI-specific modules (`cli.py`, integration with `todo.py` and `mcphandler.py`), focusing on UI, command handling, automation, and server orchestration. I've excluded anything already in the core service (e.g., basic LLM calls or file ops).

#### 1. **Interactive Command-Line Interface (REPL)**
   - **Description**: A full read-eval-print loop (REPL) for user interaction, allowing typed commands starting with `/` and direct LLM queries.
   - **How it works**: `interact()` function handles input parsing, command dispatch, error handling, and prompt formatting. Prompts dynamically show the current model and streaming mode (e.g., `[gpt-4]>`).
   - **Unique to CLI**: Robodoglib doesn't include a REPL—it's a service library. The CLI turns it into an interactive app.
   - **Benefits**: Enables real-time, conversational interaction without writing scripts.

#### 2. **Comprehensive / Command Palette**
   - **Description**: Over 20 built-in commands (e.g., `/help`, `/models`, `/model <name>`, `/key <provider> <key>`, `/getkey <provider>`, `/folders`, `/include`, `/curl`, `/play`, `/mcp`, `/import`, `/export`, `/clear`, `/stash`, `/pop`, `/list`, parameter setters like `/temperature`, `/streaming`/`rest`, `/todo`).
   - **How it works**: `parse_cmd()` splits commands, maps to actions via if/else in `interact()`. Commands leverage the service but add CLI-specific logic (e.g., `/mcp` sends raw MCP ops).
   - **Unique to CLI**: Robodoglib has core methods (e.g., `ask`, `set_model`), but not a packaged command system. CLI adds the UI layer for easy access.
   - **Benefits**: Simplifies use without code; includes utilities like stash management and streaming toggles.

#### 3. **TODO Automation Integration (`/todo` Command)**
   - **Description**: Direct trigger for the `TodoService` to run the next task from `todo.md` files.
   - **How it works**: Calls `svc.todo.run_next_task(svc)` on `/todo`, processing tasks end-to-end (gather knowledge, call LLM, update focus files, log diffs).
   - **Unique to CLI**: While `todo.py` is a separate module, its automatic execution via a simple CLI command is a CLI-exclusive feature. Robodoglib doesn't include the todo runner—it's added in the CLI for workflow automation.
   - **Benefits**: Enables one-click execution of AI-driven code/file updates based on markdown checklists.

#### 4. **MCP Server Management and Startup**
   - **Description**: Launches and manages a full HTTP/TCP MCP server thread for file ops and as a backend for the CLI.
   - **How it works**: `run_robodogmcp()` in `mcphandler.py` starts the server with bearer auth, and `main()` in `cli.py` configures and serves it alongside the REPL. Supports concurrent connections via `ThreadedTCPServer`.
   - **Unique to CLI**: Robodoglib has an MCP *client* (`call_mcp`), but not the server. The CLI adds server orchestration, CORS support, and HTTP dispatch.
   - **Benefits**: Turns the app into a self-contained file server and MCP gateway, enabling remote access and automation.

#### 5. **Colorized and File Logging with CLI-Level Configuration**
   - **Description**: Advanced logging setup including colored console output, file logs, and CLI flags for log level/filtering (e.g., `--log-file`, `--log-level`).
   - **How it works**: Uses `colorlog` for themes and `logging` for file output; configured in `main()`.
   - **Unique to CLI**: Robodoglib may log internally, but CLI adds user-configurable, colored output and persistence to files.
   - **Benefits**: Better debugging and auditing for interactive sessions.

#### 6. **CLI-Specific Configurations and Flags**
   - **Description**: Command-line arguments for customization (e.g., `--folders`, `--host`/`--port`, `--token`, `--model`, `--backupFolder`, `--log-file`/`--log-level`).
   - **How it works**: `argparse` in `main()` parses and applies settings (e.g., sets `svc.backup_folder` or initial model).
   - **Unique to CLI**: Robodoglib doesn't include CLI parsing or startup configuration—it's a library.
   - **Benefits**: Flexible deployment (e.g., custom roots, logging paths, or backup dirs).

#### 7. **Background File Watching and Auto-Execution**
   - **Description**: Watches `todo.md` files for external changes and auto-runs tasks.
   - **How it works**: `_watch_loop()` in `todo.py` polls mtimes and triggers `run_next_task()`. Integrated into CLI startup via threading.
   - **Unique to CLI**: While `todo.py` handles watching, the CLI makes it daemonized and seamless. Robodoglib doesn't include background automation.
   - **Benefits**: Hands-off operation; changes to markdown trigger AI actions implicitly.

#### 8. **Backup Folder and Diff Logging on File Updates**
   - **Description**: For each focus-file update, backs up the original to a timestamped folder and logs a unified diff beside the file.
   - **How it works**: Configured via `--backupFolder`; implemented in `todo.py`'s `_process_one()` with `difflib` for diffs.
   - **Unique to CLI**: Robodoglib has basic file ops, but not automated backups or diffs. CLI adds this for safety and traceability.
   - **Benefits**: Prevents data loss and provides audit trails for AI-generated changes.

#### 9. **Knowledge Fence Support in TODO Files**
   - **Description**: Parses and includes custom ` ```knowledge` ` code fences from `todo.md` as additional context for tasks.
   - **How it works**: `_load_all()` in `todo.py` detects fences and appends content to prompts.
   - **Unique to CLI**: An extension of the todo runner unique to the CLI's workflow integration.
   - **Benefits**: Allows task-specific, user-defined context without external files.

#### Summary
These features make the CLI a standalone, user-friendly application atop Robodoglib's core services. The CLI adds the "interactive, operational" layer: interface, commands, automation triggers, and server management. If Robodoglib covers ~60-70% of the functionality (core AI and ops), the CLI's new features represent the remaining ~30-40%, focusing on usability, configuration, and workflow tools.

If "robodoglib" refers to something specific (e.g., a web lib or subset), provide more details for a refined list! 

Now, marking this task as Done:  
- [x] ask: list the new features that are not in the robodoglib that are not in the cli  

(Interpreted as "not in robodoglib but in the cli" based on context.)
