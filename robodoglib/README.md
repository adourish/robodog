## How It Works

Robodog integrates chat history and knowledge into the questions posed:

```javascript
const _messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "chat history:" + context },
    { role: "user", content: "knowledge:" + knowledge  },
    { role: "user", content: "question:" + text + ". Use the content in knowledge and chat history to answer the question." }
];
```

### Syntax

‚Ä¢ `/include all`  
‚Ä¢ `/include file=*.txt` ‚Üí glob search across all roots  
‚Ä¢ `/include pattern=*zilla*.txt` ‚Üí shorthand for a full‚Äêroots search  
‚Ä¢ `/include dir=temp pattern=*zilla*.txt recursive` ‚Üí deep search under ‚Äútemp/‚Äù folders,

> Note: patterns use Unix-style globs (`*`, `?`), not full regex.

### What Gets Injected

1. A SYSTEM message containing the full contents of each file, tagged with  
   ```  
   --- file: /path/to/file.ext ---  
   (file contents‚Ä¶)  
   ```  
2. A second SYSTEM message containing a brief summary of the included files:  
   ```  
   File: /path/to/file.ext (1234 bytes)  
   File: /another/path/foo.js (  87 bytes)  
   ```  
3. Your original user prompt is augmented with that summary.

### Examples

1. Include every file under your served roots:  
   ```
   /include all
   ```
2. Include exactly one markdown file (README.md must exist somewhere in your roots):  
   ```
   /include file=README.md
   ```
3. Include every JavaScript file in a single directory (non-recursive):  
   ```
   /include dir=src pattern=*.js
   ```
4. Include all Python files under `lib/` and its subdirectories:  
   ```
   /include dir=lib pattern=*.py recursive
   ```
5. Combine `/include` with a follow-up question:  
   ```
   /include dir=docs pattern=*.md recursive
   Please summarize the public API defined in these markdown files.
   ```

### Supported File Formats

Thanks to MCP, you can include any text-based file. Common examples:

‚Ä¢ Markdown: `.md`, `.markdown`  
‚Ä¢ Plain text: `.txt`, `.text`  
‚Ä¢ JSON: `.json`  
‚Ä¢ Source code: `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.go`, `.rs`  
‚Ä¢ Configs & data: `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.xml`, `.csv`

Just adjust the `pattern=` glob to match the extensions you need.

## Import/Export Commands

Use the `/import` command to open a file picker and select files for import.
