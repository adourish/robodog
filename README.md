# Robodog AI

# About

Robodog AI assistant is a lightweight and portable UI that utilizes OpenAI GPT models and is built with React, TypeScript, and Webpack. It does not require a backend server, as it primarily relies on OpenAI for its functionality.

# Features

Robodog AI Assistant provides a flexible runtime, allowing installation on a laptop, Github pages, or a personal static file server without the need to install npm or run a node server. The webpack build generates two files, compiling them into a single HTML file named `robodog.html` and a JavaScript bundle called `robotdog.bundle.js`. Additionally, the tool does not require npm installation as it simply prompts for the API key, which is stored in local storage.

All chat history is conveniently accumulated in the 'chat context' text box, ensuring seamless continuation of conversations with the GPT AI. The feature allows users to add or remove chat contexts as needed. Users can also incorporate their knowledge, code, or documents for AI assistance and pose questions for optimized interactions.

Furthermore, users can effortlessly switch between GPT3.5 and GPT4 models without losing their chat context, enabling them to validate their questions and answers on a different model. Additionally, the system allows flexibility in choosing between cost-effective and higher-priced models, ensuring diverse options for tailored AI interactions.

# Accessibility

The UX was developed with section [508](https://www.section508.gov/) and [web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) in mind. All of the actions (e.g., /clear, /gpt-4, /rest /help) can be executed from the chat window without navigating a menu. I have validated the UI using the [Wave tool](https://wave.webaim.org/.), but I have not tested the UX with a screen reader like [Jaws](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/). I am confident that the UX should work for the /rest mode; the/stream mode will not work. If one single person messages me and has a need for an accessible GPT client, I will play around with the Aria tags and make /stream mode accessible.
